**Prof. Zeppetello Research & Carbon Cycle Dynamics**

This repository contains tools, analyses, and data workflows developed as part of the Carbon Cycle Dynamics research led by Prof. Zeppetello. The project focuses on understanding and modeling variations in the carbon cycle through data-driven analysis, atmospheric measurements, and environmental datasets.

**Project Overview**

The project integrates multiple research and computational components to:

- Process, clean, and harmonize large environmental datasets (e.g., meteorological, atmospheric, and carbon flux data).

- Analyze temporal dynamics in carbon cycle indicators using statistical and data-driven techniques.

- Automate data diagnostics, completeness evaluation, and visualization of key variables across time.

- Support reproducible and extensible workflows for ongoing carbon cycle research.
