**Extreme Coastal Climatology Research**
**Led by UC Berkeley Prof. Zeppetello**

This repository contains tools, analyses, and data workflows developed as part of Prof. Zeppetello’s research on extreme coastal temperature variations. The project focuses on understanding and modeling long-term global climatological extremes, particularly those affecting coastal environments, through data-driven statistical analysis, land-based observations, and oceanic buoy measurements.

**Project Overview**

The project integrates multiple research and computational components to:

Process, clean, and harmonize large environmental datasets (e.g., meteorological, atmospheric, and oceanographic data).

Quantify and analyze temporal trends in extreme temperature and climate indicators using statistical and machine learning techniques.

Automate data diagnostics, completeness evaluation, and visualization of key variables over time and across spatial scales.

Enable reproducible and extensible workflows for long-term climate research focused on coastal and marine interfaces.
